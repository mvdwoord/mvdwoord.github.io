It must have been my 6th birthday when I got this fabulous book from my dad called [De schaal van Richter en andere getallen](http://www.vanmaanen.org/hans/boeken/svr.html) (Richter's scale and other numbers). The book explains many of the codes and numbers we encounter everyday but most people either ignore or remain blissfully unaware of. Think of the numbers on the side of car tires, on trains, road numbering systems, various indexes or scales for natural phenomena etc. It also explained various types of barcodes (ISBN / EAN / DX Film), usually found on everyday stuff you buy. In a time before the internet, books like these where a real treasure trove, especially for a little pointdexter like 6yo me.

## Usage
With the mass adoption of smartphones with cameras, barcodes (especially [QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)) gained in popularity. Often used to exchange information such as [contact information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard), [calendar events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar#Events_.28VEVENT.29) or WiFi access codes. These are not part of the QR Code standard however. Like most barcodes, they simply contain data (text and numbers) and leave the interpretation to the application.

My interest in barcodes revived while I was investigating ways of long term storage of sensitive data. Having built and maintained datacenters for 15 odd years, I am quite aware of pitfalls in long term storage using electronic media. Apart from straight up failure / corruption there is the concern of compatibility. Will I be able to decode my information in the future and will the hardware still be around when I need it. For example, what would you do if you wanted to recover some information from a 5.25" floppy disk formatted in Atari 8-bit? Given enough time and resources you would probably be able to find the necessary hardware, and figure out how to read the disk but it will be far from easy. Think about it, the technology is "only" 30 years old and already eradicated completely, from a practical perspective.

I think I can deal with not being able to recover my notes from when I was a kid, or the saved goals from [Kick Off 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_Off_(series)#Kick_Off_2, even though there were some real beauties there. However, as I grow older I am becoming more concerned with proper long term storage of rather important information. Some examples are private keys (PGP / SSH / passphrases) or cold storage of digital currency.

## Considerations
There is extensive experience with storing information on paper, it has a proven track record and the handling and storage of documents is well understood by everyone. This more or less tackles the issue with mechanical (hardware) failure, and as an added benefit, it allows for easy and secure deletion. Burn baby burn.

The format used for storing the data on paper should be well documented, and preferably trivial to implement from the specification in the extreme case it goes out of fashion. It should also be "open", i.e. not some proprietary format which might lead to any legal issues or dependency on some copyright/patent holder.

Some stuff you can just print out as is, but for some things it is also necessary to have an easy way of re-digitizing it.  Manually typing in 4096 bytes is manageable but quite error prone and very tedious. Imagine the pain if you need to digitize 10 times that. OCR is an option but this problem is actually exactly what barcodes have been invented for.

Lastly there is the issue of data integrity. Even though it would be a good idea to have this already present in the riginal data, an additional independant layer of error correction seems to make a lot of sense. Obvioulsy the format should also be able to hold the amount of information you want to store, preferably without resorting to splitting the information in multiple chunks.

Luckily there are plenty [barcode formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Matrix_.282D.29_barcodes) to choose from, of which at least some seem to fit the bill.

## Creation
There are many [online](http://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/index.php) [barcode](http://www.barcode-generator.org/) [generators](http://www.terryburton.co.uk/barcodewriter/generator/) which is very convenient if you quickly need to generate one for whatever reason. There are however certain limitations/downsides, apart from having to be connected. I suspect (although I haven't checked) most of these do not provide an API for programmatic / bulk generation. Of course this is not an issue if you want to generate a barcode only once.

Even if there would be bulk/API generators online, another problem is the need for you to send the data you are generating barcodes over the net. It will be processed by a third party (and as we all know by know, probably 10 other parties as well) with obvious privacy/security implications.

Most applications you can run locally are not free, both beer- and speechwise but there is a very nice library called [Barcode Writer in Pure PostScript](http://bwipp.terryburton.co.uk/) currently maintained by [Terry Burton](https://github.com/terryburton). Someone has also been nice enough to write a python binding for this which is called [elaphe](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elaphe/) which makes it very practical to use.
