I decided to move away from wordpress.com for reasons. Attracted to a static site generator, wanting some more flexibility and control, planning to build out my github repositories etc. signs were pointing towards Jekyll. I forked a theme I liked, started migrating some old blog posts, and after some modifications I felt it's time to go ahead and make the initial commit.

I will probably continue to finnick with the CSS as well as some page layouts but hopefully mostly just focus on content. The two thing I'd like to figure out is how to bundle posts and images into directories and possibly find/make a way to deal with multi-part posts. Ideally I'd like to do something with the front end matter and have Jekkyl transform it into some sort of index or something. Not completely sure.

Since the weather is nice, and I have some exams to prep for, goodbye for now.
