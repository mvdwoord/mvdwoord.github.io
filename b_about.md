What is it all about? Not much really, please move along.. nothing to see here.

This is just a place for me to empty my mind, like a notebook or a diary or rubber duck. Although nothing private, I wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone else but me reading it. Hopefully writing down some stuff will help me in learning, bring a little structure to my life and perhaps increase my awareness of the things I do and how I do them. Maybe not.

Who am I? just another miracle of life. A run of the mill, 30-something procrastinator. Sometimes curious, pleasantly surprised, a bit bored, slightly annoyed but generally pretty much laid back. Trying to enjoy the ride, trying to make sense but not trying all too hard.

Enjoy your ride, be free.
